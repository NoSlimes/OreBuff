# OreBuff Mod

The **OreBuff** mod enhances the mining experience in Minecraft by adjusting loot tables to make several ores drop more raw ores by default, without the need for Fortune enchantments (though fortune still works). This mod is aimed at decreasing the grind for a more relaxed playstyle. 

## Features

- **Enhanced Drops:** Ores modified by the OreBuff mod will yield a (configurable) higher number of resources upon mining.

- **Configuration Options:** Customize your mining experience by adjusting the values in the config file. You can for example enable/disable extra drops for certain ores or set their drop rates.

## Configuration

The mod provides a configuration file where players can enable/disable or even add their own ores and set their drop rates according to their preferences.

  **Note:** You will need to restart the game for changes to take effect

**Warning:** Enabling ancient debris in the configuration may allow players to infinitely farm netherite scraps. Use caution when configuring this option.

**Warning:** Entering invalid statements in the configuration file **WILL** cause the file to be overwritten with the default config file. Make sure to make backups or save the file to your clipboard when experimenting with it.

1. **Installation:**
   - Install the OreBuff mod
